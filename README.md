# Airgead-Banking


  This project was built to gain investment data through input from the user, and provide a balance sheet as-well as calculate interest values. This code could be improved with additional features for the user, as-well as a better user interface. This was the first time I used multiple source and header files together, and I feel this allowed the code to be readable and maintanable as new functions can be added later. As an early C++ project I feel my Try, Do, and Catch statements worked well and the overall code had few errors in syntax or debugging. In the future this program could be improved by incorporating python for added security, as well as providing more options for functions and calculations to the user.
